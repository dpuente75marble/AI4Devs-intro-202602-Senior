Act as a senior frontend engineer designing production-ready code (2026 standards).

Refactor the reverse string solution following clean architecture and maintainability principles.

Requirements:

Architecture:

- Use <script type="module">.
- No global variables.
- No IIFE (module scope handles encapsulation).
- Separate concerns (DOM handling vs business logic).
- Make the reverse function pure and easily testable.
- Prepare the code so it could scale into a larger application.

Implementation:

- Unicode-safe reverse implementation.
- Real-time reverse while typing.
- Enable button only when input length > 3.
- No inline styles.
- Clean semantic HTML.
- Minimal DOM queries (cache elements).
- Use modern ES2022+ syntax.
- Add concise, meaningful comments.
- Keep the solution minimal but production-ready.

Code quality:

- Defensive programming.
- Readable naming.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Follow current frontend best practices (2026).

Act as a senior frontend engineer and UX/UI designer (2026 standards).

Improve the existing reverse string solution visually while respecting the original exercise requirements.

Constraints:

- Keep HTML and JS separated.
- Maintain Unicode-safe reverse implementation.
- Keep real-time reverse behavior.
- Show the button only when input length > 3.
- Ensure it works by opening index.html directly (file://), without requiring a local server.

UI/UX requirements:

- Use Bootstrap via CDN.
- Create a modern glassmorphism-inspired layout.
- Make the design responsive.
- Use semantic HTML.
- Add subtle UX improvements (character counter, status badge, clear button).
- Keep the interface clean, readable, and professional.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.

Follow current frontend best practices (2026).
